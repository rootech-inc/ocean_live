## 📝 Founder’s Note
Ocean started as a personal project to **automate my daily work** — managing attendance, generating salaries, and tracking customers and services.  
Instead of keeping it private, I decided to open-source it, so the **community can innovate, improve, and benefit** together — ensuring Ocean stays open and independent of any single company.

## 🌍 Vision
Ocean is an **all-in-one open-source enterprise suite**, starting with **CRM**, **HRM**, and **IT & Maintenance Ticketing**, and expanding into a full ERP system.  
Our goal is to create a **community-driven platform** that grows with real-world business needs.
